## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Boop sink** (`FYI.Sink.Boop`) - push notifications to your phone through a self-hosted [Boop](https://github.com/chrisgreg/boop) server. Configure `url` and `api_key`; optional `source`, `level`/`levels` (per-event-glob), `dashboard_url` ("Open in FYI" button) and `actions`. The event name is sent as the Boop fingerprint so repeats group in the inbox.
- **Ecto prefix configuration** - Support namespacing through PostgreSQL schemas, also called "prefixes" in Ecto.
  - Excluding the `prefix` configuration will use primary schema (usually public).

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-28

### Fixed

- **Nested route support** - InboxLive now correctly handles URLs when mounted in nested scopes (e.g., `/admin/fyi` instead of just `/fyi`)
  - Event detail URLs now respect the route prefix where the LiveView is mounted
  - Navigation between index and detail views works correctly regardless of scope nesting

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Automatic HTTP retries** - `FYI.Client` module with exponential backoff for sink delivery
  - Retries transient failures (network errors, 5xx status codes) up to 3 times
  - Exponential backoff with delays of 1s, 2s, 4s
  - Respects `Retry-After` response headers
  - Configurable via `:http_client` config (max_retries, retry_delay)

### Changed

- Sinks now use `FYI.Client.post/2` for HTTP requests instead of raw `Req.post/2`
